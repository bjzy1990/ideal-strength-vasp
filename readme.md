<p>
First you need to modify vasp code. If you want to calculate ideal tensile strength, you should add 'FCELL(1,1)=0.0' to constr_cell_relax.F of vasp code. That means the Stress at x axis is fixed and vasp not relax the lattice at x axis. And if you choose ideal shear strength, you should add 'FCELL(1,3)= 0.0' and 'FCELL(3,1) = 0.0' to constr_cell_relax.F of vasp code.  Here, you need to recompile vasp.</p>
<p>
second, you should prepare input.dat and this file as below:<br>
<br>
POSCAR<br>
<br>
0.02 #strain<br>
<br>
20   #step<br>
<br>
-45.0 35.264390 0.0  # rotate Z, Y and X.<br>
<br>
1                     # 1 tensile, 2 shear<br>
<br>
mpiexec -np 8 vasp.4.6<br>
</p>

The first line is the name of POSCAR.<br>
The second line is strain of distortion.<br>
The third line is total step of distortion.<br>
The fourth line is degree of rotation. This is for calculating special orientation. For example, if you want to calculating ideal strength of Diamond along 100, you just set 0.0 0.0 0.0. If you want to calculate 110 orientation, you need set -45.0 0.0 0.0. If you want to calculate 111 orientation, you need set -45.0 35.264390 0.0.<br>
<br>
Note that second modified version (strength3.py) is for rotating the x, y and z axis as a Right-handed helical rule. Previous strength2 version can also be used, just rotating y is not a Right-handed helical rule. Thus rotations for this version can be easily understood.<br>
The five line is to choose tensile of shear.<br>
The sixth line is execute command.<br>

If you have any question or find bug, I am pleased that you send email to me.<br>

This code was programed under guidance of Prof. Ma Yanming and Li Quan.<br>
<br>
At that time, I was a Ph.D candidate at State Key laboratory of Superhard Materials, Jilin university<br>
